This assignment is a traffic simulator using linked lists.


Running the program

1. Open terminal to the directory of the Makefile

2. type in the command "make"

3. Once the program compiles type the command "bin/runMe" and type in the location of the text file.

4. The prorgam will then output the traffic simmulation.

5. In terminal use the command make clean

6. The program has then been successfully created


Running the test program

1. Open terminal in the directory of the Makefile

2. type in command "make test"

3. Once the program compiles type the command "bin/test"

4. The tests will then run for the linked list

5. In terminal use the command make clean



The program does not have any simulations as i was unable to finish it on time. I also was not capable of getting the DeleteList or Delete data from list functions to work.
