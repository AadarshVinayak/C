This code is my recrreation of the shell. The code first reads in the values from the user and generates all the arguments. The line is then sent to a function where it tries to find any special functions, like outputting or inputting from a file or running the process in the background. Once it is determined wheather or not the functions inputted require special treatment. The command is then run through a fork process that makes sure it is the parent before executing. Once the command is executed it outputs results or errors and then allows the user to re enter commands.

To use the program you must open a terminal with all the files in it and call make. The file will then compile and generate a msh file. To then run the program you must write the command ./msh. Once that happens You can type anything within the command line.

In terms of the actual code, I wasnt capable of running the command as a background process or craeting my personally made functions. Otherwise the code works to a point.
